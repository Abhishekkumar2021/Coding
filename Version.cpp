/*
You are given two versions numbers A and B as a string. Your task is to compare them
and find out which one of them is a newer version.
Note:
There are no leading zeros in any of the strings except in the case of zero itself. Note that, the leading zeroes are not allowed even after a ie: 121.005 is an invalid version, while 121.5 is an valid version.
For Example:
"1.23.45"
"1.23.456"
The first, the third, two parts of both the strings are the same i.e 1 and 23 and part of B is greater than the third part of A i.e. 45 < 456, thus string B is the latest version.
