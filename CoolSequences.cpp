/*
Ninja is a big fan of some cool sequences. Let 'A' denote a cool sequence. Ninja says a sequence is cool if the following conditions are satisfied.
Each element of the sequence should be distinct.
The sequence should be of length 'N'.
Each element should have a value between 1 to 60000.
Let 'M' denote the sum of all the elements of the sequence and 'K' be the gcd of all the elements of the sequence then 'K' should be equal to 1 and for each element, 'A[i]' (0 <= i < 'N') gcd of 'A[i]' and 'M' should not be equal to 1.
Return any cool sequence in any order. If an answer exists, the output will be 1, otherwise the output will be 0. Nonetheless, if an answer exists, return the sequence, otherwise return -1 in an array.
Note: Assume 0-based indexing.
For Example:
Let 'N' = 3.
'A' = {2, 3, 63} satisfies all the conditions of the cool sequence.
